# senseair-s8-co2
Capture and display CO2 data from the Senseair s8 sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi.
This repository contains the code necessary to capture CO2 readings every 5 minutes and record those values.
Records can be accessed and displayed in a graph to show trends over time and to indicate when CO2 readings exceed a safe limit.
This project was written for the purpose of detecting leaks from a CO2 tank with a hose that comes undone easily.
